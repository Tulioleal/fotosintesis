## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tool-aware assistant

The assistant SHALL use tools for knowledge search, trusted web search, taxonomy validation, ingestion, embeddings, garden lookup, reminder creation and light measurement lookup when appropriate. The assistant SHALL expose structured reminder suggestions for user confirmation when it proposes a reminder from conversation context instead of directly creating one.

#### Scenario: Missing reminder data

- **WHEN** the user asks the assistant to create a reminder but plant, date, time or recurrence is missing
- **THEN** the assistant asks for the missing information before creating it

#### Scenario: Reminder suggestion requires confirmation

- **WHEN** the assistant proposes a reminder from conversation context and has plant, action, due date, due time and recurrence values
- **THEN** the assistant response includes an actionable reminder suggestion with the plant, action, due timestamp, recurrence and justification instead of relying only on message text
